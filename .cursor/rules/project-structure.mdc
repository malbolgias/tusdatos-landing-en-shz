# Project Structure Guide

The project follows a structured organization with key files and directories:

## Core Configuration Files
- [PLANNING.md](mdc:PLANNING.md) - Contains project architecture and tech stack details
- [TASKS.md](mdc:TASKS.md) - Tracks current tasks and progress
- [PROJECT_RULES.md](mdc:PROJECT_RULES.md) - Project-specific development rules
- [RULES.md](mdc:RULES.md) - General project rules and guidelines

## Content Organization
- All content should be placed in `src/content/` using Markdown files
- Use Astro's content collections for organizing different content types
- Keep content separate from presentation logic

## Component Structure
- Components should be placed in `src/components/`
- Keep components modular and under 300 lines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow semantic HTML practices

## Build and Deployment
- Build output goes to `dist/` directory
- GitHub Actions handles deployment
- Keep build artifacts clean and optimized
